# Patatap Clone

I have built this app following the architecture of popular website/application *PATATAP.com* which generates various animations and sounds on different key strokes. 

It generates randomly positioned and colored circles (which animate) and plays different sounds when user presses any key between A to Z on the keyboard. I have used ***PaperJS*** (using PaperScript) and ***HowlerJS*** libraries to achieve this functionality.
